RAINFALL PREDICTION USING FUZZY LOGIC 

This project focuses on predicting rainfall levels using a fuzzy logic approach. Fuzzy logic is used to manage uncertainty in weather parameters and provide more flexible decision-making compared to traditional models.

•Dataset :
Meteorological data containing parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind conditions was used to estimate rainfall levels.

•Technologies Used :
Python,
Fuzzy Logic,
NumPy, Pandas,
Matplotlib

•Methodology :
Weather data was first preprocessed and converted into fuzzy sets. Fuzzy rules were then applied to model the relationship between meteorological parameters and rainfall. The system produces rainfall predictions based on fuzzy inference.

•Results :
The fuzzy logic model was able to estimate rainfall levels effectively by handling imprecise and uncertain weather data, showing reliable prediction behavior.
